    <summary>CloneSpy is a Free Duplicate File CleanUp Tool for WindowsÂ© XP/Vista/7/8</summary>
    <description>CloneSpy can help you free up hard drive space by detecting and removing duplicate files. Duplicate files have exactly the same contents regardless of their name, date, time and location. Also, CloneSpy is able to find files that are not exactly identical, but have the same file name. Perhaps you have different versions of a file and you want to find all of them and remove the older versions. CloneSpy can also find zero length files. These are files that have no content.
	
	CloneSpy is available in both 32-bit and 64-bit versions. The appropriate version for your system will be installed automatically.</description>

    <releaseNotes>* Added: When moving files to a relative path, the path can now be resolved relative to the respective file (see Deletion page of the Options window).
* Added: A checksum is now only stored in the database if the corresponding file is larger than a configurable value (see Database page of the Options window).
* Modified: The encoding "OEM" is now the default setting for batch files.
* Fixed: Eliminated a bug where an installed version was detected as portable version.
* Fixed: Added an explanation for the formerly unknown error code 17.

Changes from 3.32

* Added: The new Extensions page in the Options window allows to specify file extensions that are different but should be considered as equal. This option is enabled by default.
* Modified: The scan progress window can now be closed via the close button in its title bar after a scan is finished.
* Fixed: Corrected an overflow of the "Scanning for duplicates" progress bar in the scan progress window (regression since v3.31).
* Fixed: If a folder is added to a pool which contains many sub-folders of that folder, then the warning message no longer overflows.
* Fixed: The uninstaller now works properly for 32-bit Windows.
