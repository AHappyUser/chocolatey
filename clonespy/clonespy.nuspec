    <summary>CloneSpy is a Free Duplicate File CleanUp Tool for WindowsÂ© XP/Vista/7/8/8.1/10</summary>
    <description>CloneSpy can help you free up hard drive space by detecting and removing duplicate files. Duplicate files have exactly the same contents regardless of their name, date, time and location. Also, CloneSpy is able to find files that are not exactly identical, but have the same file name. Perhaps you have different versions of a file and you want to find all of them and remove the older versions. CloneSpy can also find zero length files. These are files that have no content.
	
	CloneSpy is available in both 32-bit and 64-bit versions. The appropriate version for your system will be installed automatically.</description>

    <releaseNotes>Changes in 3.43

* Added: You can now exclude sub-folders when marking or unmarking files in a folder via the context menu of the list box in the All duplicates window.
* Added: Remembered window sizes and positions can now be reset to their default values (see Misc page of the Options window).
* Modified: Hard links and shortcuts are now created before the file to be replaced is deleted (see Deletion page of the Options window).
* Modified: Leftover files are now deleted at the end of a scan to prevent deletion conflicts (see Deletion page of the Options window).
* Modified: Deleted leftover files are now counted in the scan progress window and listed in the log file if deleted files have to be logged (see  Logging page of the Options window).
* Modified: The title of the Main window now contains the program version.
* Modified: Renamed the Priority page of the Options window to Misc.
* Modified: Renamed Execute file to Open file in the context menu of the Single duplicates window and All duplicates window.

Changes from 3.42

* Added: Folders can now be scanned non-recursively, i.e., sub-folders can be ignored (see Pool frames of the Main window).
* Added: When moving files to a relative path, the path can now be resolved relative to a retained file (see Deletion page of the Options window).
* Added: Files with paths that are too long for CloneSpy to process can now be generally ignored (see Files page of the Options window).
* Modified: The installer no longer requires administrator privileges for unpacking the portable version.
* Fixed: Added an explanation for the formerly unknown error code 1392.

Changes from 3.41

* Added: Files and folders that are ignored during scanning can now be logged (see Logging page of the Options window).
* Added: A new option remembers size and position of the Add folder window (see Priority page of the Options window).
* Added: The new command line option -s allows for silent scans (see the help file for details).
* Added: A message box now explains the Delete all (!) option on the Time + Size page of the Options window when that option is selected.
* Modified: Removed the entry Programme from the default folder ignore list (see Folders page of the Options window).
* Fixed: Hitting the space bar while a scan is ongoing no longer closes the scan progress window.

Changes from 3.40

* Modified: Reimplemented the pools and consolidated related feedback messages to resolve several visualization issues.
* Modified: For all Windows versions prior to Windows 10, DPI scaling is now performed by the system to solve icon scaling issues. For Windows 10, you need to adapt the program's DPI scaling behavior if icons are displayed too small (see our FAQ).
