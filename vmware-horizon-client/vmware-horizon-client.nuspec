    <releaseNotes>* Next Generation Horizon Client for Windows installer
    * The Horizon Client for Windows installer has been updated to provide an enhanced user experience.
* Virtualization Pack for Skype for Business
    * You can run Skype for Business inside a virtual desktop without negatively affecting the virtual infrastructure and overloading the network. All media processing takes place on the Windows client machine, instead of in the virtual desktop, during Skype audio and video calls. To use this feature, you must install the Virtualization Pack for Skype for Business on the client machine during Horizon Client installation. A Horizon administrator must also install the Virtualization Pack for Skype for Business on the virtual desktop during Horizon Agent installation.
* 32-bit Core Remote Experience component
    * You can use the Horizon Client for Windows installer to install the 32-bit Core Remote Experience component on a 64-bit Windows client machine.
* Windows 10 Creators Update support
    * You can install Horizon Client for Windows on a Windows 10 Creators Update machine.
* Recursive Unlock feature
    * The Recursive Unlock feature unlocks all remote sessions after the client machine has been unlocked. This feature applies only after a user logs in to the server with the Log in as current user feature. To enable this feature, you set the **Unlock remote sessions when the client machine is unlocked** group policy setting.
* vdm_client.adm template file has been removed
    * The vdm_client.adm template file has been removed from Horizon Client for Windows. You must use the vdm_client.admx template file instead.
* Scrolling wheel pad support
    * You can use a scrolling wheel pad on a laptop with the VMware Blast and PCoIP display protocols.
* Support for Workspace ONE Mode
    * Beginning with Horizon 7 version 7.2, a Horizon administrator can enable Workspace ONE mode for a Connection Server instance. If you connect to a Workspace ONE mode enabled server in Horizon Client for Windows, you are redirected to the Workspace ONE portal to launch your entitled desktops and applications.
