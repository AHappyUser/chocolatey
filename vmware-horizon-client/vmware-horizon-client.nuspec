    <releaseNotes>* Support for Blast Extreme Adaptive Transport (BEAT)
    * With the VMware Blast display protocol, Horizon Client for Windows uses TCP networking when it connects to a server or BEAT if the agent and Blast Secure Gateway (if enabled) support BEAT connectivity. You can select network condition options to use only TCP networking or BEAT networking.
* Hide security information for enhanced security
    * A Horizon 7 version 7.1 administrator can configure global settings to hide security information in Horizon Client for Windows, including server URL information and the **Domain** drop-down menu. To authenticate when the **Domain** drop-down menu is hidden in Horizon Client, you must provide domain information by entering your user name in the format domain\username or username@domain in the **User name** text box.
* Restart a remote desktop
    * You can restart a remote desktop from Horizon Client for Windows. Restarting a remote desktop is the equivalent of the Windows operating system restart command.
* Proxy fail over with PAC file in Internet Explorer
    * Horizon Client supports proxy fail over with the **Use automatic configuration script** setting under **Automatic configuration** in **Internet Options > Connections > LAN settings** in Internet Explorer. To use this setting, you must create an automatic configuration script (PAC file) that returns multiple proxy servers.
* Resolution helper tooltip shows remote desktop resolution
    * If you drag a corner of the remote desktop window to resize it, a tooltip displays the screen resolution in the lower-right corner of the window
* Unauthenticated access to remote applications
    * A Horizon 7 version 7.1 administrator can create Unauthenticated Access users and entitle those users to remote applications. Unauthenticated Access users can log in to the server anonymously from Horizon Client for Windows and connect to their remote applications. For information about creating Unauthenticated Access users, see the View Administration document.
* Support for Microsoft Aero Peek
    * Horizon Client for Windows supports the Microsoft Aero Peek feature.
* OpenSSL 1.0.2k support
    * The OpenSSL library is updated to version openssl-1.0.2k.
