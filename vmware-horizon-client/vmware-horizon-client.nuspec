    <releaseNotes>The **4.6.1** release of Horizon Client for Windows includes a new command-line installation property called AUTO_UPDATE_ENABLED. This property determines whether the online update feature is enabled in Horizon Client for Windows. A value of 1 enables the feature. A value of 0 disables the feature.

The **4.7** release of Horizon Client for Windows contains the following new features:

* VMware Blast network recovery improvements
  * The VMware Blast network recovery feature has been improved to be resilient against transient network failures by providing network continuity to remote desktops and applications. Applications and desktops will seamlessly resume on network connection resumption.
* Session Collaboration
  * When the session collaboration feature is enabled for a remote desktop, you can invite other users to join an existing remote desktop session, or you can join a collaborative session when you receive an invitation from another user.
* USB autoconnect features for published applications
  * The USB autoconnect features, including URI queries, command-line options, and group policy settings, now apply to published applications as well as remote desktops.
* Block multiple instances with group policy
  * You can use the "Block multiple Horizon Client instances per Windows session" group policy setting in the Horizon Client Configuration ADMX template file to prevent users from launching multiple Horizon Client instances during a Windows session.
* Windows 10 Fall Creators Update support
  * Horizon Client now supports Windows 10 1709 SAC (Fall Creators Update).
* URL content redirection with the Chrome browser
  * URL content can now be redirected in the Chrome browser. To use URL Content Redirection with the Chrome browser, you must enable the VMware Horizon URL Content Redirection Helper extension for Chrome.
* Fingerprint scanner redirection
  * With the device bridge feature, you can redirect biometric devices, specifically fingerprint scanners, that are plugged into a serial port on the Windows client system to virtual desktops, published desktops, and published applications.
* High color accuracy with VMware Blast
  * You can use the VMware Blast High Color Accuracy option to allow increased color fidelity when using H.264 decoding.
