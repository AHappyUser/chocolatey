    <releaseNotes>* Full support of Flash Redirection
    * For specific URLs, Flash content in an Internet Explorer browser is sent to the Windows-based client and played in a Flash container window, thereby offloading demand on the ESXi host. Configuration is done through group policy. This feature also requires Horizon Agent 7.0 or later.
* Command-line interface enhancement
    * Enhancement to Horizon Client's Command-line interface to allow the launcher to be visible after launching an application.
* Automatic upgrade
    * Horizon Client can be upgraded through the user interface.
* Client device authentication
    * The device that Horizon Client runs on can be authenticated.
* Support for login as current user in a nested environment
    * In a nested environment (Horizon Client running on a Horizon desktop and accessing another Horizon application or desktop), users can login as current user.
* Launching multiple Horizon Client instances using URI
* OpenSSL 1.0.2h support
    * The OpenSSL library is updated to version openssl-1.0.2h.
