    <releaseNotes>The **4.6.1** release of Horizon Client for Windows includes a new command-line installation property called AUTO_UPDATE_ENABLED. This property determines whether the online update feature is enabled in Horizon Client for Windows. A value of 1 enables the feature. A value of 0 disables the feature.

The **4.6** release of Horizon Client for Windows contains the following new features:

* Support for pre-launched applications
  * A Horizon 7 administrator can configure a published application so that an application session is launched before you open the published application in Horizon Client. When a published application is pre-launched, the application opens more quickly in Horizon Client. This feature requires Horizon 7 version 7.2 or later on the server.
* Support for server-created Start menu shortcuts for remote desktops and published applications
  * A Horizon 7 administrator can configure Start menu shortcuts for remote desktops and published applications. If you are entitled to remote desktops or published applications that have shortcuts, Horizon Client places the shortcuts in the Start menu on your local system when you connect to the server. This feature requires Horizon 7 version 7.3.1 or later on the server.
* HTML5 multimedia redirection with Chrome
  * A Horizon 7 administrator can configure the HTML5 Multimedia Redirection feature to redirect HTML5 multimedia content from a remote desktop to your local system when you use the Chrome browser. Because your local system plays the HTML5 multimedia content, you have a better audio and video experience. The HTML5 Multimedia Redirection feature is enabled by default in Horizon Client during installation. A Horizon 7 administrator must enable HTML5 Multimedia Redirection in the remote desktop during Horizon Agent installation. Horizon Agent 7.3.1 is required.
* New command-line properties for the Horizon Client for Windows installer
  * The following command-line properties have been added to the Horizon Client for Windows installer:
  * INSTALL_HTML5MMR - specifies whether to install HTML5 Multimedia Redirection support.
  * REMOVE - specifies the features not to install.
  * STARTMENU_SHORTCUT - specifies whether to create a Start menu shortcut for Horizon Client on your local system.
* Support for UNC paths with client drive redirection
  * You can now use the client drive redirection feature to redirect mapped drives that have UNC (Universal Naming Convention) paths.
* USB redirection support in nested mode
  * The USB redirection feature is now supported when you use Horizon Client in nested mode.
* SHA-256 support
  * Horizon Client has been updated to support the SHA-256 cryptographic hash algorithm.
* OpenSSL 1.0.2l support
  * The OpenSSL library is updated to version openssl-1.0.2l.
