    <releaseNotes>* Select specific monitors in a multiple-monitor setup
    * You can use the selective multiple-monitor feature to select the monitors on which to display a remote desktop window. This feature is not supported for remote applications. For details, see "Select Specific Monitors in a Multiple-Monitor Setup" in [Using VMware Horizon Client for Windows](https://www.vmware.com/pdf/horizon-view/horizon-client-windows-43-document.pdf).
* Disable and hide the client drive redirection feature
    * You can use the Disable sharing files and folders group policy setting to specify whether client drive redirection functionality is available in Horizon Client. When this setting is enabled, all client drive redirection functionality is disabled in Horizon Client, including the ability to open local files with remote applications, and client drive redirection elements are hidden in the Horizon Client user interface.
* Single installer for 32-bit and 64-bit systems 
    * A single installer is provided for 32-bit and 64-bit systems. The installer automatically detects your system type and installs the correct version of Horizon Client for Windows.
* Configure application resumption behavior
    * You can use the Disconnected application session resumption behavior group policy setting or the vmware-view -appSessionReconnectionBehavior command-line option to configure how running applications behave when you reconnect to the server. The group policy setting takes precedence over the command-line option.
* H.264 encoder multiple-monitor enhancement
    * You can now use H.264 decoding with multiple monitors. For details, see "Configure VMware Blast Options" in [Using VMware Horizon Client for Windows](https://www.vmware.com/pdf/horizon-view/horizon-client-windows-43-document.pdf).
* Nested mode enhancements
    * You can use Windows Server 2008 R2 when running Horizon Client in nested mode. In addition, the URL content redirection and clipboard redirection features are supported in nested mode. For a complete list of the operating systems and features that are supported in nested mode, see "Features Supported in Nested Mode" in [Using VMware Horizon Client for Windows](https://www.vmware.com/pdf/horizon-view/horizon-client-windows-43-document.pdf).
* Real-Time Audio-Video (RTAV) support for session-based desktops on Windows Server 2016
    * Real-Time Audio-Video is supported for session-based desktops on Windows Server 2016 RDS hosts. This feature requires Horizon Agent 7.0.3 or later.
* Windows 10 Long-Term Servicing Branch (LTSB) version 1607 support
    * You can install Horizon Client for Windows on a Windows 10 LTSB version 1607 system.
* OpenSSL 1.0.2j support
    * The OpenSSL library is updated to version openssl-1.0.2j.
