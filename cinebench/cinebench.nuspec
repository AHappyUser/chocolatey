    <description>Cinebench is a real-world cross-platform test suite that evaluates your computer's hardware capabilities. Improvements to Cinebench Release 20 reflect the overall advancements to CPU and rendering technology in recent years, providing a more accurate measurement of Cinema 4D's ability to take advantage of multiple CPU cores and modern processor features available to the average user. Best of all: It's free.

Cinebench is the perfect tool to compare CPU and graphics performance across various systems and platforms.

Only compatible with 64-bit Operating Systems.</description>

    <releaseNotes>* Cinebench R20 uses a much larger and more complex test scene than R15 requiring about 8x the computational power needed to render it. The test also requires about 4x the memory.
* Cinebench R20 and Cinema 4D R20 incorporate the latest rendering architectures, including integration of Intelâ€™s Embree raytracing technology and advanced features on modern CPUs from AMD and Intel that allow users to render the same scene on the same hardware twice as fast as previously.
* Cinebench R20 provides improved benchmark accuracy for current and next generation CPUs to test if a machine runs stable on a high CPU load, if the cooling solution of a desktop or notebook is sufficient for longer running tasks to deliver the full potential of the CPU, and if a machine is able to handle demanding real-life 3D tasks.
